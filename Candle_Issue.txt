Mary really likes to read. She reads in the morning, she reads during the afternoon, and she reads at night. When laying in bed, Mary especially likes to read by candlelight.

One night, Mary had fallen asleep reading her favorite book: CLRS. She was awoken in the middle of the night to the smell of something burning. Mary had a candle issue.
